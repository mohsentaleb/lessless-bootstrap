"LESS"less Bootstrap
==================
For those who love bootstrap and hate LESS in the same time!

It's simply compiled version of bootstrap ".less" files in separate ".css" files for easier development. All these files are "@imported"ed in `bootstrap.css` so that you could only link to this file in your HTML page and have all the bootstrap awsomeness.

How to Use
==========

- Copy all the files to your css folder
- include `[your-css-folder]/bootstrap.css` in your HTML page
>	`<link href="/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />`
- write your website-specific css styles in `website.css`
